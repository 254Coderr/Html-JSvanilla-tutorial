## HTML Lesson

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 

An HTML document is made up of a head and a body. The head contains information about the document, such as the title and meta tags. The body contains the visible content of the document.

**HTML tags and attributes**

HTML tags are used to define different elements on a web page. For example, the `<h1>` tag defines a heading, and the `<img>` tag defines an image. HTML tags can have attributes, which provide additional information about the element. For example, the `src` attribute on the `<img>` tag specifies the source of the image.

**Common HTML elements**

Some of the most common HTML elements include:

* `<html>`: The root element of all HTML documents.
* `<head>`: The head section of an HTML document contains information about the document, such as the title and meta tags.
* `<body>`: The body section of an HTML document contains the visible content of the document.
* `<p>`: A paragraph element.
* `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.: Heading elements.
* `<img>`: An image element.
* `<a>`: A link element.

**Creating images and tables**

To create an image on a web page, use the `<img>` tag. The `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag specifies the source of the image.

To create a table on a web page, use the `<table>` tag. The `<tr>` tag defines a table row, and the `<td>` tag defines a table cell.

**Linking to other web pages**

To link to another web page, use the `<a>` tag. The `href` attribute of the `<a>` tag specifies the URL of the other web page.

**Adding CSS and JavaScript to an HTML document**

To add CSS to an HTML document, use the `<link>` tag. The `rel` attribute of the `<link>` tag should be set to `stylesheet`.

To add JavaScript to an HTML document, use the `<script>` tag. The `src` attribute of the `<script>` tag specifies the source of the JavaScript file.

**Learning more about HTML**

The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is a great resource for learning more about HTML. 
# Regex Practical

This lesson is a practical introduction to regular expressions (regex). Regex is a powerful tool for searching and manipulating text. It is used in many different programming languages and applications, including HTML, JavaScript, and Python.

## What is regex?
Regex is a pattern that can be used to match text. A regex pattern is made up of a sequence of characters and special characters. The special characters have special meanings, such as matching any character or matching a specific word.
## How to use regex
To use regex, you need to create a regex pattern and then use it to match text. You can use regex in many different ways, such as:
* Searching for text in a document
* Extracting text from a document
* Validating text
* Replacing text in a document
## Regex examples
Here are some examples of regex patterns:
* `^abc$` - Matches the exact string "abc"
* `\w+` - Matches one or more alphanumeric characters
## Inspecting the console
To inspect the console, you can use the `console.log()` function to print output to the console. For example, the following code will print the string "Hello, world!" to the console:
##To practice using regex,the following exercises was helpful:
* Write a regex pattern to match email addresses.
* Write a regex pattern to match phone numbers.
* Write a regex pattern to validate a password.

## Conclusion
Regex is a powerful tool for searching and manipulating text
